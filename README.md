## 🧐 Why this template?

> Why shouln't I just create my own project from scratch?

It's all about your time, you will save the time of installing all dependencies, configuring them, make them compatible, and test them, which can go between **4 hours** to **over 10 hours** depending on your skills.

> [!NOTE]
> Even if all the packages installed solve common issues and tasks of a full stack web application, you will be able to remove any of them. The instructions are on the docs.

## 💨 Quickstart

### ⬇️ Downloading

#### By forking the repository (recommended)
This is the easies way to get started, and the way I recommend you to do it. You just simply need to:

1. Click on the `fork` button and give it a name (or keep the same).
2. From your forked version, click on the `use this template` button, and then click on `create new repository`.

This will create a new repository with all the files of this repository. Now you can start configuring your github, and jump to the local installation.

3. Click on the `code` button and copy the url. It is something like `https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git`.
4. Go to your computer, at the folder you want to save the project in, and open a new terminal.
5. Paste down the line below, and click enter.

```bash
git clone <your url>
```

You are all set, you have the template in a new project and ready to be configured.

#### By downloading the files
You can instead, download all the source files and create your project from them.

1. Click on the `code` button and then click on `Download ZIP`.
2. Save the ZIP file on your workspace folder.
3. Right click and unzip the folder.

Done, you have all the files on your desktop, now you can start editing them, and then configure the repository your own.

### ⚙️ Configurations

> [!WARNING]
> This repository uses `pnpm` package loader, so it will be installed on your machine. Do not worry, you can choose to use the default npm on your other projects with no extra configurations.

#### Packages Installation

1. Install all the packages, and run all the initial checks using the code line below:

```bash
npm run init
```

#### Info Configurations
The project includes some information you need to modify for your project, start by:

2. Going to `package.json` file and modify the name and version of the project.
3. Go to `@/config.ts` and modify all the values matching your project information.

#### Adding the environmental variables
At this point you are almost all set, just need to add all the environmental variables related with the services you will be using.

4. Go to `.demo.env` file and check what environmental variables you will need.
5. Create a file called `.env.local` and copy all the variables names and the values (you should get the values following the service docs, it will be below).
6. That's it.

> [!CAUTION]
> Your environmental variables (mostly secret keys) should not be shared with anyone, the file is already ignore by github, so it will be only at your computer. Sharing it with anyone, or leaking it by hard-writting them on your client code could result on theft, attacks, and over-usage of the service by cyber criminals.

You are all set, now you can run some commands to verify the installation went well. If one of the comnmands fail (commonly the tests), you should check what did you did wrong.

> [!TIP]
> The most common failure case on this installation is because of an environmental variable not well configured, so that could be your first place to look.

1. Verify the linters and formatters by using:

```bash
pnpm format:fix
```

then,

```bash
pnpm lint
```

2. Run all the demo and services test suits by calling:

```bash
pnpm test
```

If everything went well, you are all set!

## Getting Started
### Github Actions

This project does run 2 github workflows: `validator` and `preview`

#### Code Validator Workflow

This workflow will run all the tests to ensure the project meet the guidelines and common coding structure.

After running this workflow, you will make sure that:

- The code formatting meets the repository standards.
- The code passed the lint test, so no coding errors are present.
- The code has passed all the test suits.
- The code has 100% coverage. You can opt-out this by removing or commenting the last 2 lines on the `.github/workflows/validator.yml` file.

#### Preview Deployment Workflow

This workflow will ensure that the code builds correctly, and will provide a preview deployment at Vercel, so you can check how everything is rendering.

**How to setup**
1. You must go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), login and create a new project, and deploy it.
2. Go to your github repository setting.
3. Go to `secrets and variables/actions/new repository secret`, and add the following variables:
  - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: On your account settings/general, under VERCEL ID name.
  - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: On your project settings, under the same name.
  - `VERCEL_TOKEN`:  On your account settings/tokens, you must create a new one.

### Project Config & SEO

#### Config.ts

There is a file called `config.ts` at the route `.src/` which contain all the values for the project information, it is important that you fill them up, because they are used in some other components, including `@/components/SEO.ts`, the object that gives all the SEO metadata at the root layout.

#### SEO

We have added SEO automatically to the root layout, you can check them by opening the `@/components/seo.ts` file. However, there are some configurations you must follow for an optimized SEO.

1. Go to `public/robots.txt` and add all the robots url rules.
2. Go to `public/manifest.json` and create the manifest for your site.
3. Add all the icons you set on the manifest to the `/public/icons/` folder.
4. Create a cover image for the social media, change its name to `og.png` and save it on the `/public/` folder.
5. You are all set with SEO for the homepage, you can use the same SEO object on other pages layouts, or create your own custom based on the structure of that `ROOT_SEO` object.

## Components
### Light/Dark Theme

This project have implemented the light and dark theme, which you can manipulate using the `useTheme()` react hook, or using the `ThemeSwitcher` button component at `@/components/functional/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`.

#### Theme Context & Provider

Is the provider that will handle the current theme on the application, save the selected theme on the local storage, and load the theme from the storage/match prefer-color-scheme if first visit.

It is located at `@/contexts/themeContext` and it does have exports:
- `ThemeProvider`: The provider that must wrap all the application.
- `useTheme`: The react hook that will allow you to recover and set the current theme.

<br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The provider must wrap the whole application, so we added it at the root layout. If you remove it, the hook and helper component will not be able to switch themes.

#### ThemeSwitcher React Component

This button uses the `useTheme` hook to switch the current theme when clicked.

You can just use it anywhere in the app and will switch the current theme. Usage:

```tsx
import { ThemeSwitcher } from "@/components/functional/ThemeSwitch"

export default function Home() {
	return (
		<main>
			<p>Home Page</p>
      <ThemeSwitcher />
		</main>
	);
}
```

##### Styling
If you want to style the button or create a new one, check the src code.

## Custom Hooks & Libraries
These are some custom hooks and libraries added to the project to solve efficiently some common issues and tasks when developing a full stack web application.

### CryptoHash
**Type**: Library

**What's the goal?**
- `Create an encrypted hash` from a plain text. Useful when encrypting the passwords before saving them at the database.
- `Compare encrypted hash` using a plain text. Used when comparing if the password from an user is the same as the one encrypted in the database.
- `Create UUID` useful when creating id for database, or any other service.
- `Create two steps authentication codes` useful to validate if the user is really who is trying to login, verify emails, etc.

#### Methods
Use `async CryptoHash.hashString()` to encrypt any `string` value.
```ts
import { CryptoHash } from "@/libs/CryptoHash"

async function encrypt() {
    const encrypted = await CryptoHash.hashString("<text to encrypt>")
    console.log(encrypted)
}

encrypt()
```

Use `async CryptoHash.compareString()` to compare a plain text with a given hash.

```ts
import { CryptoHash } from "@/libs/CryptoHash"

async function compare() {
    const comparison = await CryptoHash.compareString("<plain text to compare>", "<your hash>")
    console.log(comparison)
}

compare()
```

Use `CryptoHash.getRandomUUID()` to get a random UUID formatted value.

```ts
import { CryptoHash } from "@/libs/CryptoHash"

const uuid = CryptoHash.getRandomUUID()

console.log(uuid)
```

Use `CryptoHash.get2StepsVerificationCode()` to get a random 6 characters code uppercased.

```ts
import { CryptoHash } from "@/libs/CryptoHash"

const code = CryptoHash.get2StepsVerificationCode()

console.log(code)
```

### DataValidation
**Type**: Library

**What's the goal?**
- `Validate data types & structure` to ensure your data is being pass as expected and avoid unexpected errors at runtime.

#### Methods
Use `DataValidation.validateEmail()` to validate that a string is an email.
```ts
import { DataValidation } from "@/libs/DataValidator"

console.log(DataValidator.validateEmail("<your likely email>"))
```

Use `DataValidation.validatePassword()` to validate that a password meet the minimum security criteria such as:
- At least 8 characters long
- At least an upper case letter
- At least a number
- At least an special character

```ts
import { DataValidation } from "@/libs/DataValidator"

console.log(DataValidator.validatePassword("<your password>"))
```

Use `DataValidation.validateObject()` to match an object structure and value types with a provided schema.

```ts
import { DataValidation } from "@/libs/DataValidator"

const schema = {
  name: "string",
  age: "number",
  other: {
    isUser: "boolean"
  }
}

const exampleObj = {
  name: "Jonathan",
  age: 22,
  other: {
    isUser: true
  }
}

console.log(DataValidator.validateObject(exampleObj, schema))
```

### useViewport
**Type**: React Hook

**What's the goal?**
- `Handle window resize events` getting the current width and height for responsible designs or minimum/maximum sizes requirements.

#### How to use?
Use `useViewport` to get real-time width and height values
```tsx
"use client"

import { useViewport } from "@/hooks/useViewport"

function TestComponent() {
  const { width, height } = useViewport()

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current width: {width}, Current height: {height}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Clerk Auth

Clerk auth is the authentication provider we do use.

### Usage
1. Go to [Clerk Website](https://clerk.com/) and create a new account.
2. Create a new project/app and configure it.
3. Copy and paste all the clerk-related enviromental variable names from `demo.env` to `.env.local`
4. Get your public and priivate keys from `Clerk Dashboard/API Keys`.
5. Add your custom onboarding by following the official [docs](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/add-onboarding-flow).

> [!CAUTION]
> Do **not** share your private key with anyone.

See all the pages on `src/auth` to know how to use it, or read the official docs.

### How to remove

1. Uninistall the package using:
```bash
pnpm remove @clerk/nextjs
```

2. Remove from the `src/middleware.ts` file with following content:

Note: If that all the file contain, then delete the file completely.

```ts
import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export default clerkMiddleware();

export const config = {
	matcher: ["/((?!.*\\..*|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};

```

3. Go to the root layout at `/src/app/layout.tsx` and remove the `<ClerkProvider>` tags from the code, and the importation of it.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/contexts/themeContext";

<ClerkProvider>
  {...}
</ClerkProvider>
```

4. Go to `/src/app/page.tsx` and remove the following code:

```tsx
import {
	SignInButton,
	SignUpButton,
	SignedIn,
	SignedOut,
	UserButton,
} from "@clerk/nextjs";

<SignedOut>
	<h1>You are currently signed out, please sign in:</h1>
	<br />
	<SignInButton />
	<SignUpButton />
</SignedOut>
<SignedIn>
	<h1>You are currently signed in.</h1>
	<br />
	Profile: <UserButton /> <br />
	<a href="/auth/protected-client">Protected Page (Client)</a> <br />
	<a href="/auth/protected-server">Protected Page (Server)</a> <br />
</SignedIn>
```

5. Remove the folder `src/app/auth` completely.

## Resend Service

### Usage
1. Get the API key of Resend Mailing, and save it to the `.env.local` file, follow demo naming.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please, use this service only on server components and/or api endpoints to avoid leaking the key with the client code.

Use `EmailService.Send()` to send an email using a react component as template. See `src/services/mail-templates.tsx` for an example:

```ts
import { EmailService } from "@/services/Mail"
import { DemoEmailTemplate } from "@/service/mail-template"

async function Run() {
  const response = await EmailService.Send(
    {
      name: "Codixfy",
      email: "sales@codixfy.com"
    },  // From info
    ["example@mail.com"], // To emails
    "Hello world!", // Subject
    DemoEmailTemplate // React component
  )
}
```

Or if you prefer raw html, then use `EmailService.SendRaw()`:

```ts
import { EmailService } from "@/services/Mail"

async function Run() {
  const response = await EmailService.Send(
    {
      name: "Codixfy",
      email: "sales@codixfy.com"
    },
    ["example@mail.com"],
    "Hello world!",
    `
      <p>Hello world, this is a body</p>
    `
  )
}
```

### How to remove
1. use `pnpm remove resend` to remove the library
2. Delete the files `src/services/Mail.ts` and `src/services/mail-templates.tsx`

## Firebase -> Cloud Storage & Database

We use `Firebase` for our files cloud storage, and database, so it is configured to work the authentication with Clerk.

### Setting Up Auth
1. Go to `Clerk` dashboard, go to integrations, and activate `firebase`
2. Follow the setup instructions on the clerk page to complete the integration.
3. To sign in, you can do it in 2 different ways:

#### Client Side
```tsx
"use client"
import { auth } from "root/firebaseConfig";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { signInWithCustomToken } from "firebase/auth";

export function DemoComponent() {
  const { getToken, userId } = useAuth();
  const [user, setUser] = useState<any>(null)

  const handleAuth = async () => {
      const token = await getToken({ template: "integration_firebase" });
			const userCredentials = await signInWithCustomToken(auth, token || "");

      setUser(userCredentials.user)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleAuth}>Login to Firebase</button>
      <p>{user}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Server Side
```tsx
"use server"
import { auth } from "root/firebaseConfig";
import { auth as ClerkAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import { signInWithCustomToken } from "firebase/auth";

export async function GET() {
  const { getToken, userId } = ClerkAuth()

  const token = await getToken({ template: "integration_firebase" });
	const userCredentials = await signInWithCustomToken(auth, token || "");

  return Response.json({
    data: userCredentials.user
  })
}
```

You must have `authentication`, `storage`, and `database` services enabled on your Firebase Console in order to use these services.

### Storage Service
This service allows you to store, read, and delete files on the Firebase cloud services.

#### Usage
1. Create your Upload Object, and add the firebase auth.

It must handle the authentication with firebase (using clerk) within the same component, to do so you must use the following code (on a client component)

```tsx
"use client"
import { auth } from "root/firebaseConfig";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { signInWithCustomToken } from "firebase/auth";

export function UploadComponent() {
  const { getToken, userId } = useAuth();

  const handleAuth = async () => {
      const token = await getToken({ template: "integration_firebase" });
			const userCredentials = await signInWithCustomToken(auth, token || "");

      return userCredentials.user
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Upload Files</h2>
    </div>
  )
}
```

2. You can create an upload input for selecting the files, and store them on a state.

```tsx
"use client"
import { auth } from "root/firebaseConfig";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { signInWithCustomToken } from "firebase/auth";
import React, {useState} from "react" // Added this line

export function UploadComponent() {
  const { getToken, userId } = useAuth();
  const [filesLib, setFilesLib] = useState<FileList | null>(null);  // Added this line

  const handleAuth = async () => {
      const token = await getToken({ template: "integration_firebase" });
			const userCredentials = await signInWithCustomToken(auth, token || "");

      return userCredentials.user
  }

  // Added this function to handle the files input change
  const handleFilesChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const files = e.target.files

    if (files) {
			setFilesLib(files);
		}
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Upload Files</h2>
      <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} /> // Added this line
    </div>
  )
}
```

3. We will add the handle to upload the file

```tsx
"use client"
import { auth } from "root/firebaseConfig";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { signInWithCustomToken } from "firebase/auth";
import React, {useState} from "react"
import { StorageService } from "@/services/storage"; // Added this line

export function UploadComponent() {
  const { getToken, userId } = useAuth();
  const [filesLib, setFilesLib] = useState<FileList | null>(null);  // Added this line
  const [data, setData] = useState({
		bytesTransferred: 0,
		totalBytes: 0,
		progress: 0,
	}); // Added this state to handle the data results
  const [url, setUrl] = useState("")  // Added this state to handle the url

  const handleAuth = async () => {
      const token = await getToken({ template: "integration_firebase" });
			const userCredentials = await signInWithCustomToken(auth, token || "");

      return userCredentials.user
  }

  const handleFilesChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const files = e.target.files

    if (files) {
			setFilesLib(files);
		}
  }

  // Added this function to handle the upload proccess
  const handleUpload = async () => {
    // Check if the user session is available and there's at least a file
    if(filesLib && userId) {
      // We create an instance of the storage service
      const upload = new StorageService(userId)

      // We handle the login
      const authResult = await handleAuth()

      // Check if we succeed in the auth
      if(authResult) {
        // Preparing the listening for the uploading update event
        upload.on("uploading", (data) => {
          // This data is updated on each new change event
          setData({
            bytesTransferred: data.bytesTransferred,
					  totalBytes: data.totalBytes,
					  progress: data.progress,
          })
        })

        // Preparing the listening for the completed event
        upload.on("completed", () => {
          // Get all metadata
          const metadata = upload.getMetadata()

          console.log("Finished uploading")

          // Save the URL
          setUrl(metadata.downloadURL)

          // -> Do whatever you want, like saving the url to a database.
        })

        // Preparing the listening for errors
        upload.on("error", (error) => {
          // -> Handle the error as you need
          console.log("An error ocurred while uploading the file")
          console.log(error)
        })

        // Start upload proccess
        await upload.UploadFile(filesLib[0])

      } else {
        // In case auth failed
        console.log("The authentication to firebase failed")
      }
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Upload Files</h2>
      <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} /> // Added this line
    </div>
  )
}
```

Done! We have uploaded the file successfully.

> [!WARNING]
> You should save the download url in a database linked to the user that uploaded, so you can fetch it to show it, or delete as needed later on.

To delete the image, you have the static method `StorageService.DeleteFile()` and pass the download url as argument.

```ts
// Do not forget to sign in to firebase if you haven't done already
import { StorageService } from "@/services/storage";

async function DeleteFile(url: string) {
  const res = StorageService.DeleteFile(url)

  console.log(res)
}

DeleteFile("<the download url>")
```

> [!NOTE]
> We have created a demo component at `src/.examples/components/UploadComponent.tsx` so you can test it out.

### Database Service
This service allows you store any data in a non-sql (documents based) database powered by firebase aka Google.

#### Usage
> [!WARNING]
> Do not forget to sign in to firebase with clerk if you haven't done already before using any of these methods.

Import the service using:

```ts
import { DatabaseStorage } from "@/services/database"
```

To create a document, use the `setDocument()` method: 

```ts
import { DatabaseStorage } from "@/services/database"

const collectionName = "your collection name"
const data = {
  // Your data to add
}

async function Run() {
  const db = new DatabaseStorage("<user id>")

  // Create the document
  const res = db.setDocument(collectionName, data)

  console.log(res)
}

Run()
```

To get an specific document on a collection for the same user use the `getDocument()` method:

```ts
import { DatabaseStorage } from "@/services/database"

const collectionName = "your collection name"

async function Run() {
  const db = new DatabaseStorage("<user id>")

  // Create the document
  const res = db.getDocument(collectionName)

  console.log(res)
}

Run()
```

To update an specific document on a collection for the same user use the `updateDocument()` method:

```ts
import { DatabaseStorage } from "@/services/database"

const collectionName = "your collection name"
const data = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 22
}

async function Run() {
  const db = new DatabaseStorage("<user id>")

  // Create the document
  const res = db.updateDocument(collectionName, data)

  console.log(res)
}

Run()
```

To delete an specific document on a collection for the same user use the `deleteDocument()` method:

```ts
import { DatabaseStorage } from "@/services/database"

const collectionName = "your collection name"

async function Run() {
  const db = new DatabaseStorage("<user id>")

  // Create the document
  const res = db.deleteDocument(collectionName, data)

  console.log(res)
}

Run()
```

To do a query you can use the static method `query()`:

```ts
import { DatabaseStorage } from "@/services/database"

const collectionName = "your collection name"
const field = "email"
const email = "sales@codixfy.com"

async function Run() {
  const result = DatabaseService.query(collectionName, field, email)
  
  console.log(result)
}

Run()
```
